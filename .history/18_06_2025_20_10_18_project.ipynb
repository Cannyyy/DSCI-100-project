    "# Predicting Newsletter Subscription from Demographics and Play Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**: The UBC Minecraft server project collects player data to help manage server resources and improve player engagement strategies. One key goal is to understand what kinds of players are likely to subscribe to the server newsletter, which serves as a way to share updates and strengthen the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: This project investigates the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Can we predict whether a player will subscribe to the newsletter based on their age and total number of hours played?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we will use data from the following source:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `players.csv`, which contains each player's demographic information (including age), total number of hours played (`played_hours`), and subscription status (`subscribe`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses only on the `players.csv` dataset. By using demographic information (`Age`) and behavioral information (`played_hours`), we aim to determine whether these variables are useful predictors of newsletter subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this approach because:\n",
    "- Age may relate to interest in community updates.\n",
    "- Players who spend more time in-game may be more engaged and thus more likely to subscribe."

    "## Methods & Results\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore whether a player's age and total played time can help predict their newsletter subscription status, we followed several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- We used the `players.csv` dataset, which contains each player's age, total played hours, and subscription status.\n",
    "- We kept only the necessary columns: `Age`, `played_hours`, and `subscribe`.\n",
    "- We removed any rows with missing values to ensure a clean dataset for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splitting the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- We split the dataset into a **training set** (75%) and a **testing set** (25%) using random sampling.\n",
    "- The training set was used to teach the model how age and played hours might relate to newsletter subscription.\n",
    "- The testing set was used to evaluate how well the model performs on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- We trained a **K-nearest neighbors (KNN)** classification model using `Age` and `played_hours` as the predictor variables, and `subscribe` as the response.\n",
    "- The model identifies patterns in training data to classify new players as likely subscribers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- We evaluated the model using **accuracy**, which measures the proportion of correct predictions on the test set.\n",
    "- A higher accuracy means that `Age` and `played_hours` are useful predictors of subscription status.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis helps us understand whether player demographics (age) and behavior (play time) are useful indicators of newsletter interest."
